        It is possible for logs to be received for a container before we have
        marked it for attachment and hence cause those logs to be skipped and
        never sent to the backend. Waiting for a lock before attaching makes
        this more likely to happen and is unnecessary as we are not directly
        interacting with/affecting the container and it only affects the
        journalctl tailing

      hash: 2952818cf3412fcb550fa981e178771678007fd8
      body: >
        The code was incorrectly casting the result of detailedDiff as
        ServiceConfig,

        which prevented environment variable redaction from working. This caused

        sensitive environment variables (API keys, passwords, tokens) to be
        logged

        in plain text in debug logs.


        Fixed by:

        - Creating a proper DetailedDiff interface for the return type

        - Correctly redacting environment variables from added/deleted/updated
        sections

        - Adding tests to verify environment variables are properly redacted

      hash: 8ffdba7d187a00d846d2c76c3416a45e02bf0e93
      body: >
        Supervisor has had memory leaks removed since v16.5.1, with latest
        tested

        version being v16.7.1. Furthermore, on recent reported instances of
        memory healthcheck

        triggering on support, we've snapshotted the heap before & after on
        devices multiple times

        without finding any evidence of memory leaks in the snapshots.


        Therefore, it's hypothesized that the heuristic for determining starting
        memory may

        be flawed in that it's not waiting long enough after system startup, or
        it may

        run right after garbage collection has happened. Because of the
        variability and

        difficulty of ascertaining these factors, we suspect an inaccurate
        memory

        baseline may be the cause of the instances of false positives on
        support.

      body: >
        The current target state apply is cancelled when either:

        - /v1/update is called with cancel: true

        - A different target state is received from the cloud (with a non-304
        status)


        Following apply cancellation, a target state apply is re-triggered. This
        ensures

        that the user can force a device out of a dead-locked situation where a
        long-running

        task such as an image fetch fails to cede control back to the
        Supervisor, which is

        the behavior observed in an Engine bug with infinite pull retries with a
        bad network.

      body: |
        A contract including extra requirement fields, such as "name" would fail
        validation. This PR removes any extra fields from the validated contract
        to prevent services with these extra fields from getting rejected by the
        contract validation.

      body: |
        The leftover locks search was creating an array rather than an object
        keyed by the appId. This could affect the lock cleanup and make leftover
        locks from one app affect the install of the app in local mode.

    - subject: Add Docker network label if custom ipam config
      hash: b596c77ce2d229e79082cbb1f0022f93806f09ae
      body: >
        In a target release where the only change is the addition or removal

        of a custom ipam config, the Supervisor does not recreate the network

        due to ignoring ipam config differences when comparing current and
        target

        network (in network.isEqualConfig). This commit implements the addition
        of

        a network label if the target compose object includes a network with
        custom

        ipam. With the label, the Supervisor will detect a difference between a

        network with a custom ipam and a network without, without needing to
        compare

        the ipam configs themselves.


        This is a major change, as devices running networks with custom ipam
        configs

        will have their networks recreated to add the network label.

      hash: 7764f98c9d357a1942628e57951266767555f67b
      body: |
        The previous behavior required that dependencies were running beefore
        starting the dependent service. This made it that services dependent on
        a one-shot service would not get started and goes against the default
        docker behavior.

        Depending on a service to be running will require the implementation of
        [long syntax depends_on](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/services/#long-syntax-1) and the condition
        `service_healthy`.

      hash: bdbc6a4ba4766f9466891497bc02bd33aff1d4c7
      body: |
        We have observed that even when setting the socket timeout on the
        state poll https request, the timeout is only applied once the socket is
        connected. This causes issues with Node's auto family selection (happy
        eyeballs), as the default https timeout is 5s which means that larger
        [auto select attempt timeout](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/net.html#netgetdefaultautoselectfamilyattempttimeout) may result in the socket timing out before all connection attempts have been tried.

        This commit sets a different https Agent for state polling, with a
        timeout matching the `apiRequestTimeout` used for other request events.

      body: |
        If the Supervisor receives a 401 Unauthorized from the delta server
        when requesting a delta image location, we should surface the error
        instead of falling back to a regular pull immediately, as there could
        be an issue with the delta auth token, which refreshes after
        DELTA_TOKEN_TIMEOUT (10min), or some other edge case.

      hash: 341111f1f94cd9f17fd7be9b6f21e3bc22c9ad3a
      body: >
        This prevents an image download error loop where the delta image on the
        delta server is present,

        but some aspect of the delta image or the base image on the device does
        not match up, causing

        the delta to fail to be applied to the base image.


        Delta apply errors don't raise status codes as they are thrown from the
        Engine (although they should),

        so if an error with a status code is raised during this time, throw an
        error to the handler

        indicating that the delta should be retried until success. Errors with
        status codes raised during

        this time are largely network related, so falling back to a regular pull
        won't improve anything.


        Upon delta apply errors exceeding DELTA_APPLY_RETRY_COUNT, revert to a
        regular pull.

        This config backend uses ConfigJsonConfigBackend to update

        os.power and os.fan subfields under the "os" key, in order

        to set power and fan configs. The expected format for os.power

        and os.fan settings is:

        ```

        {
          os: {
            power: {
              mode: string
            },
            fan: {
              profile: string
            }
          }
        }

        ```


        There may be other keys in os which are not managed by the Supervisor,

        so PowerFanConfig backend doesn't read or write to them. Extra keys in
        os.power

        and os.fan are ignored when getting boot config and removed when setting

        boot config.


        After this backend writes to config.json, host services os-power-mode

        and os-fan-profile pick up the changes, on reboot in the former's case

        and at runtime in the latter's case. The changes are applied by the host

        services, which the Supervisor does not manage aside from streaming

        their service logs to the dashboard.

      body: >
        Add `os-power-mode.service`, `nvpmodel.service`, and
        `os-fan-profile.service`

        which report status from applying power mode and fan profile configs as
        read

        from config.json. The Supervisor sets these configs in config.json for
        these

        host services to pick up and apply.


        Also add host log streaming from `jetson-qspi-manager.service` as it

        will very soon be needed for Jetson Orins.

        This moves from throwing an error when an app is rejected due to unmet
        requirements (because of contracts) to storing the target with a
        `rejected` flag on the database.

        The application manager filters rejected apps when calculating steps to
        prevent them from affecting the current state. The state engine uses the
        rejection info to generate the state report.

      body: |
        Users may specify dnsu2t config by including a `dns` field

        ```
        {
          network: {
            proxy: {
              dns: '1.1.1.1:53',
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        If `dns` is a string, ADDRESS and PORT are required and should be
        in the format `ADDRESS:PORT`. The endpoint with error with
        code 400 if either ADDRESS or PORT are missing.

        `dns` may also be a boolean. If true, defaults will be configured.
        If false, the dns configuration will be removed.

        If `proxy` is patched to empty, `dns` will be removed regardless
        of its current or input configs, as `dns` depends on an active
        redsocks proxy to function.

      hash: d789e5bb77e0337773c69ed9d4e24696c019c6ac
      body: >
        The following pattern

        ```ts

        async function longRunning() {
           // do something
           await setTimeout(delay);
           await longRunning();
        }

        ```


        Is regularly used for long running operations on the supervisor (e.g.

        polling target state). We have

        recently discovered that this pattern can slowly leak memory as it

        essentially creates an infinite promise chain. Using `void
        longRunning()` breaks

        the chain and avoids the issue.


        This commit fixes all those instances where the pattern was used.

      body: |
        The balena logging backend now uses async functions to setup the
        connection and write messages to the request stream. This adds some
        backpressure on `log` calls by by the log monitor module, to prevent a
        very agressive container causing the supervisor to waste CPU cycles just
        dropping messages.

      body: |
        This removes the dependence of the supervisor on the containerLogs
        database for remembering the last sent timestamp. This commit instead
        uses the supervisor startup time as the initial time for log retrieval.
        This might result in some logs missing for services that may start
        before the supervisor after a boot, or if the supervisor restarts.
        However this seems like an acceptable trade-off as the current
        implementation seems to make things worst in resource contrained
        environments.

        We'll move storing the last sent timestamp to a better storage medium in
        a future commit.

      hash: 53f5641ef1cd2e5374f55a50a601fb80d4872511
      body: >
        The host-config module exposes the following interfaces: get,

        patch, and parse.


        `get` gets host configuration such as redsocks proxy configuration

        and hostname and returns it in an object of type HostConfiguration.


        `patch` takes an object of type HostConfiguration or
        LegacyHostConfiguration

        and updates the hostname and redsocks proxy configuration, optionally

        forcing the patch through update locks.


        `parse` takes a user input of unknown type and parses it into type

        HostConfiguration or LegacyHostConfiguration for patching, erroring if

        parse was unsuccessful.


        LegacyHostConfiguration is a looser typing of the user input which does

        not validate values of the five known proxy fields of type, ip, port,

        username, and password. We should stop supporting it in the next

        major Supervisor API release.

        Once input has been determined to be of type HostConfiguration,
        we can easily extract ProxyConfig from the object for patching,
        stringifying, and writing to redsocks.conf.

    - subject: Fix engine deadlock on network+service change
      hash: ede27b63cecc2a9ae3139a905d9c6ab32418a72b
      body: >
        This fixes a regression on the supervisor state engine computation

        (added on v16.2.0) when

        the target state removes a network at the same time that a service

        referencing that network is changed. Example going from


        ```

        services:
           one:
              image: alpine: 3.18
              networks: ['balena']

        networks:
           balena:
        ```


        to


        ```

        services:
           one:
              image: alpine: latest
        ```


        Would never reach the target state as killing the service in order to

        remove the network is prioritized, but one of the invariants in the
        target state calculation is

        to not kill any services until all images have been downloaded. These

        two instructions were in contradiction leading to a deadlock.


        The fix involves only adding removal steps for services depending on a

        changing network or volume if the service container is not being removed

        already.

        TODO: Upgrading io-ts to 2.2.21 will result in some unit tests for

        io-ts type validation breaking, due to a change in t.record's handling

        of decoding unknown objects. In <2.2.21, a record with a custom key type

        will decode an unknown object to Left if it has a key is not of the
        custom

        type. Whereas in io-ts@2.2.21, t.record will strip the invalid key and

        decode to Right. This is a breaking change for us.

        The `mdns-resolver` module does not provide a default export. Trying to
        use a default import notation, causes the `resolve` function to not be
        found, breaking MDNS resolution.

      hash: 14bdc522c17c924ce560da81f735b96bac41bd4d
      body: |
        Since HTTP's server.close() is async, there is a slim chance
        for two instances of /v1/reboot or /v1/shutdown to be processed.
        If the server is already closed when server.close() is called,
        the call throws ERR_SERVER_NOT_RUNNING
        which doesn't need to be surfaced to the user. This change
        only allows one server.close() attempt to occur at a time.

        The Supervisor should only care whether a lockfile exists or
        not. This also fixes an edge case where a user symlinked a lockfile
        to a nonexistent file, causing the Supervisor to enter an error
        loop as it was not able to `stat` the nonexistent file.

        a dash in the middle were returning as false when passed through the

        `DockerName.is` type guard, affecting how `getServicesLockedByAppId` was

        returning a map of locked services.

      hash: bda1bac04c708ea0c35318604f926c035ff0883b
      body: >
        RPI firmware configuration allows repeating overlays to define

        configurations on multiple devices. For instance, for configuring

        multiple `ads` devices, `config.txt` needs to be setup this way


        ```

        dtoverlay=ads1115,addr=0x48

        dtoverlay=ads1115,addr=0x49

        ```


        Before this change, the supervisor would interpret both lines as

        belonging to the same overlay, preventing users from configuring
        multiple

        devices, and leading to a loop when trying to apply configurations with

        repeated overlays coming from the cloud side.

        they are still used by a few customers with devices running OS < 2.47.1.
        This should fix v2 delta support for those devices until we can

      body: |
        Previously, getBootConfig() of the config.txt backend was omitting
        array configurations such as gpio settings, thus resulting in the SV
        mistakenly assuming that boot config had not been applied, since gpio
        would not be in current config.txt config but would be in target config.
        This resulted in SV entering an infinite loop of attempting to apply the
        gpio config when it wasn't necessary.

    - subject: Add special case for base DTO params on RPI config
      hash: 6e6a796da5ecc846248eae4c8495bc626964c038
      body: |
        While ordering is important in the RPI firmware configuration file (config.txt),
        some dt params are by default considered part of the base dt overlay
        if they are not used by other overlays.
        Unfortunately the [list of dtparams](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/blob/master/boot/overlays/README#L133)
        is too long to add all of them as exceptions, but we can add the params
        used in the default config.txt provided in OS images, to avoid reboots
        when updating to this new supervisor and correctly parsing the
        provisioning config.txt as variables.

        While this addition handles most common scenarios, there is still a
        chance a user may have use other base overlay dt params in the initial
        config, in which case those will be interpreted according to the
        relative ordering

      hash: 9546a1a3b1b919649dc401b63f0ff0dedad918b0
      body: |
        DT overlays and DT params need to be consumed in the order that they
        appear on the file. DT params apply to the last dtoverlay defined on the
        file, or to the base overlay.

        This commit updates config.txt parsing to consider this ordering, and it
        also ensures global dtparams are written first so they cannot be
        overriden by later overlays.

        Because of the more strict parsing method, it is possible that existing
        HOST_CONFIG vars do not match the interpretation of the parser. If
        that's the case, the supervisor will re-apply the target state which
        will cause the device to reboot.

      body: >
        Moby v25 adds the dynamically generated MAC address to the Config field,

        which breaks the state engine, preventing the state from settling as the

        current state never matches the target state (empty mac address). This

        seems to be a bug in Moby that we reported in moby/moby#47228


        The issue won't affect Balena devices until balenaEngine is updated, and
        this

        change fixes testing for now.

        The `updateMetadata` step renames the container to match the target
        release when the service doesn't change between releases. We have seen
        this step fail because of an engine bug that seems to relate to the
        engine keeping stale references after container restarts. The only way
        around this issue is to remove the old container and create it again.
        This implements that workaround during the updateMetadata step to deal
        with that issue.

      hash: 416170bc05a9a725f5a7f8ecbab4f8b1c8da5ddf
      body: >
        The docker EXPOSE directive and corresponding docker-compose `expose`

        service configuration serves as documentation/metadata that a container

        listens on a certain port that may be used for service discovery but it
        doesn't

        have any real impact on the ability for

        other containers on the same network to access the exposed service via

        the port. In newer engine implementations, this property may conflict

        with other network configurations, and prevent the container from being

        started by the docker engine (see #2211).


        This PR removes code that would manage the expose property and takes the

        property out of the whitelist. A composition with the `expose` property

        will result in the log message `Ignoring unsupported or unknown compose
        fields: expose`.


        While this change should not have operational impact, it still removes

        a previously supported configuration and as such there is a chance of it

        being a breaking change for some applications. For this reason it is

        being published as a new major version.

        The supervisor exposes ports configured using the `EXPOSE` directive in
        the dockerfile when configuring the container for runtime. This can
        cause issues if using `network_mode: service:<service name>` as the
        expose configuration is not compatible with that network mode. This
        fix now skips image exposed ports for that particular network mode.

        It's not an official status from container inspects, and the Supervisor

        doesn't set it internally anywhere. It's better to remove it entirely as
        the

        method by which Supervisor sets internal service statuses is by using a
        global

        event emitter (reportNewStatus) which makes things difficult to test.

    - subject: Parse container exit error message instead of status
      hash: 71d24d6e3366b28e1466e99322d58420b5ebbb67
      body: >
        The previous implementation in #2170 of parsing the container status was
        too general,

        because it relied on the mistaken assumption that a container would have
        a status of

        `Stopped` if it was manually stopped. This turned out to be untrue, as
        manually stopped

        containers were also getting restarted by the Supervisor due to their
        inspect status of

        `exited`. With this, parsing the exit message became unavoidable as
        there are no other

        clear ways to discern a container that has been manually stopped and
        shouldn't be started

        from a container experiencing the Engine-host race condition issue
        (again, see #2170).


        Since we're just parsing the exit error message, we don't need to worry
        about different behaviors

        amongst restart policies, as any container with the error message on
        exit should be started.

      body: >
        This is necessary since the builder no longer passes the platform flag

        to the build. This would lead to dockerfiles that are mixing multi and
        single

        arch stages to pull the wrong architecture images, particularly when

        trying to build images in emulated builds (e.g. armv7hf built on
        aarch64).


        Moving the full build to multi-arch solves this as the docker engine is

        capable of chosing the right architecture from the manifest.

    - subject: Handle Engine-host race condition for "always" and "unless-stopped"
        restart policy
      hash: 7f3214195838a8bf3242ef7540b4487338687e4c
      body: >
        There exists a race condition between Engine and a host resource that
        may not

        be immediately created. In this race condition, if a container's compose
        config

        depends on the existence of that host resource, such as a network
        interface, and the

        Engine tries to create & start the container before the host resource is
        created, the

        Engine will not reattempt to start the container, regardless of the
        restart policy.

        This is undesireable behavior but seems to be the behavior as
        implemented by Docker.


        To rectify this, the Supervisor state funnel noops for a grace period of
        1 minute

        after starting a container to see that the container's status has become
        'running`.

        If the container exits because of the race condition, the status becomes
        'exited' and the

        Supervisor will attempt to generate another start step. This
        noop-wait-start step loop

        will repeat until the container is able to start.


        If the container is never able to start, there was a problem in the host
        in the creation of the

        host resource, and that should be fixed at the host level.


        This commit does not handle the case of services with restart policies
        "no" or "on-failure"

        which encounter this host race, as metadata from container inspects
        needs to be introduced

        during step calculation in order to figure out whether services with
        those restart policies

        need to be started. This will be fixed in a future PR.

    - subject: "mount-partitions.sh: Add support for encrypted partitions"
      hash: 004592894474676e3d024e5636b9fccce9f173f9
      body: |
        After a recent change enforcing all the partitions to be on the same
        block device, encrypted partitions are no longer being detected
        correctly. This is because the assumption that the parent block device
        is a substring of the actually mounted block device does not work
        for LUKS devices - the mount will either be /dev/mapper/luks-XXX
        or /dev/dm-X while the parent device is still e.g. /dev/sda.

        The usual balenaOS boot partition is also split in two - boot and efi.
        The boot partition (mounted under /mnt/boot) is encrypted and the efi
        partition (mounted under /mnt/efi) is not.

        This patch generalizes the detection of the parent device so that
        it works with both encrypted and unencrypted partitions.

      hash: 33b29cfa225959dd0a58564128017e04d019ea5f
      body: |
        The docker compose V2 spec no longer accepts `network_mode: bridge`,
        which means we can no longer override the network configuration of
        the `balena-supervisor` service for tests.

        For this reason we now create a separate service to run the built
        supervisor `balena-supervisor-sut` and run API tests against this
        service instead of the default `balena-supervisor`.

      body: |
        A bug in service comparison would make it that a device already running
        a service from a new release with network changes would never stop the
        running service so remaining services would forever get stuck in
        `Downloaded` state.

        This fixes the comparison so the service will get killed in this case,
        particularly allowing devices to recover from #1576

        Devices affected by the bug described in 1576, are also stuck with some

        even if they belong to a new release. This is a bug, which can be
        replicated by the tests in this commit

        those credentials are meant for balena registry and will otherwise fail.

      body: |
        The actions now work by passing an intermediate state to the state
        engine.

        - doPurge first removes the user app from the target state and passes
          that to the state engine for purging. Since intermediate state doesn't
          remove images, this will have the effect of basically re-installing
          the app.

        - doRestart modifies the target state by first removing only the
          services from the current state but keeping volumes and networks. This
          has the same effect as before where services were stopped one by one

      hash: 967cb7747f187f70500f6393360df10b40fddebf
      body: |
        There were multiple places in the state engine that skipped some
        operations while in local mode. In reality, all it's needed while in
        local mode is to skip image and volume deletion.

        This commit simplifies application-manager and compose app to be more
        local mode agnostic and instead making the image deletion and volume
        deletion configurable via function arguments.

        This also has the benefit to make the treatment of local mode
        applications more similar to cloud mode applications, allowing for
        API endpoints to function the same way both modes.

    - subject: Mount boot partition into container on Supervisor start
      hash: 49ee1042a87ce0b101054e32b84afaa324a371de
      body: >
        As the Supervisor is a privileged container, it has access to host /dev,
        and therefore has access

        to boot, data, and state balenaOS partitions. This commit sets up the
        framework for the following:


        - Finds the /dev partition that corresponds to each partition based on
        partition label

        - Mounts the partitions into set mountpoints in the device

        - Removes reliance on env vars and mountpoints provided by host's
        start-balena-supervisor script

        - Simplifies host path querying by centralizing these queries through
        methods in lib/host-utils.ts


        This particular changes env vars for and mounts the boot partition.


        Since the Supervisor would no longer rely on container `run` arguments
        provided by a host script,

        this change moves Supervisor closer to being able to start itself
        (Supervisor-as-an-app).

      body: |
        Preloaded devices can require that the device is pinned to the preloaded
        release on provisioning. However if the provisioned release gets
        released in the future, that would lead to the device remaining in "VPN
        only" state forever as the provisioning process could not finish due to
        pinning failure.

        This commit changes the behavior so if the release does not exist, the
        pinning step is skipped and the device follows the fleet pinning state.

        The issue with the original Supervisor implementation of the firewall is
        that

        on Supervisor start, the Supervisor flushes the INPUT chain of the
        filter table.

        This doesn't play well with services that add to the INPUT chain on
        startup that

        may start up before the Supervisor, such as certain NetworkManager
        connection

        profiles. This change only replaces the BALENA-FIREWALL rule in the
        INPUT chain,

        preserving the other rules as well as their order.

        We have seen a few times devices with duplicated network names for some

        reason. While we don't know the cause the networks get duplicates, this

        can be disruptive for updates as trying to create a container
        referencing a duplicate

        network results in a 400 error from the engine.


        This commit finds and removes duplicate networks via the state engine,

        this means that even if somehow a container could be referencing a

        network that has been duplicated later somehow, this will remove the

        container first.


        While thies doesn't solve the problem of duplicate networks being

        created in the first place, it will fix the state of the system to

        correct the inconsistency.

      body: |
        We have seen a few times devices with duplicated network names for some
        reason. While we don't know the cause the networks get duplicates,
        this is disruptive of updates, as the supervisor usually queries
        resource by name, resulting in a 400 error from the engine because of
        the ambiguity.

        This replaces those queries by name to queries by id. This includes
        network removal. If a `removeNetwork` step is generated, the supervisor
        opts to remove all instances of the network with the same name as it
        cannot easily resolve the ambiguity.

        This doesn't solve the problem of ambiguous networks, because even if
        networks are referenced by id when creating a container, the engine will
        throw an error (see https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/issues/590#issuecomment-1423557871)

      hash: 6683bca07da0e6b8f822dfcb22211b24a182dc16
      body: |
        As reported by issue #2100, the supervisor was not correctly reacting to
        `SIGTERM` sent by the engine when terminating the process (for instance
        before a reboot). This would lead to the supervisor requiring an
        additional 10 seconds to terminate (after which the engine will send a
        `SIGKILL`).

        The reason for this is explained by the following info coming from Node

        > Node.js was not designed to run as PID 1 which leads to unexpected behaviour when running inside of Docker. For example, a Node.js process running as PID 1 will not respond to `SIGINT` (`CTRL-C`) and similar signals. [reference](https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/blob/main/docs/BestPractices.md#handling-kernel-signals)

        On internal testing, it was discovered that simply adding a listener for
        the signal on the Node process was enough to handle the signal, even
        when the process runs as PID 1.

        This adds a listener for `SIGTERM` before starting the supervisor main
        loop.

        The Raspberry Pi config.txt file defines the use of colon to configure

    - subject: Fix journalctl to work with persistent logs
      hash: 55594274f78d20b2d86c3bc683d7c27d7cde60c2
      body: >
        v14.4.5 introduced a new way to retrieve the host logs by symlinking the

        log directories into the host /run/log/journal and using a local copy of

        the journalctl binary instead of chrooting into the host. This failed to

        account for the location of persistent logs when that option is turned

        on (/var/log/journal instead of /run/log/journal). This fixes the checks

        consider this case and also makes sure to remove the original symlink to

        avoid having nested links `/run/log/journal/journal/journal`, which was
        a

        bug in the previous implementation.

      hash: 0605e996c9225380e39fd78b1c99cc7ad3c0f959
      body: >
        The `readFromBoot` function replaced calls to readFile in the codebase

        when the target location is under `/mnt/boot` in order to use `fatrw`

        to check for corruption. Unfortunately this function behaved a little

        differently with regards to errors. While `readFile` returns a code
        `ENOENT`

        when the file is not found, `readFromBoot` would just throw an exception

        with whatever code was given by fatrw. This would cause confusion for

        some calls that were behaving differently with a `ENOENT`, causing some

        issues.

        The supervisor had to chroot into the host root in order to read the

        an app. This commit copies the journalctl binary and necessary libraries
        from a debian image into the supervisor image in order to be able to use
        the tool on runtime.

      hash: dade5987370c68d639d698cc3e4a9d6ccf4df9c5
      body: >
        This PR changes the way the supervisor reads and writes files from
        /mnt/boot. Reads will

        now use the [fatrw utility](https://github.com/balena-os/fatrw/) as a
        way to minimize corruption of

        files in the boot partition, and thus preventing possible bricking of
        the device.


        Since this basically changes the way a lot of configurations are read,
        this work was being blocked because of

        the way tests were being done. While there still remain a couple of
        legacy tests to be migrated, this PR disables

        test:legacy tests when running npm run test, as the work on refactoring
        those tests is in progress (see #2048) and

        fatrw integration is of higher priority.

        getImagesForCleanup used to query the Engine for the Supervisor
        image, which is unnecessary given that the Supervisor has access

        The method is simplified and made more clear, and
        imageManager.isCleanupNeeded doesn't need to be stubbed in tests.

        This means that configuration backend tests no longer use stubs and
        (mostly) avoid internal dependencies in the tests. Instead of stubs and
        mock-fs, the tests use [testfs](https://github.com/balena-io-modules/mocha-pod#working-with-the-filesystem)
        which allows working with a real filesystem and ensuring everything is
        re-set between tests.

        This is the last change needed in order to be able to merge #1971. Here is the list of changes

      hash: 1034aa70e6a2e425fb4b5e0fa1155eec97b21ed2
      body: >
        Also remove system interface check from ensureSupervisorNetwork.


        Previously `ensure` was a Bluebird promise which wasn't awaited in

        its composition step. This has been here for some time and may
        contribute

        to issues with duplicate networks. The conversion to native Promises

        allows `ensure` to be awaited, hopefully reducing instances of duplicate

        networks.


        Removing the system interface check for /sys/class/net/supervisor0

        because it's superfluous given that the Engine creates the interface

        with NetworkManager. It also makes testing a lot more difficult to set
        up

        as /sys/class/net isn't a directory that can be written to for emulating

        system interface creation / removal.

        An unmanaged Supervisor will not have a balenaApi defined, so any

        state, which is useful for integration testing.

      body: |
        The state engine and preloading is performed before the device gets a
        chance to register, while this is desirable for preloaded apps, it
        introduces a delay on registration which is known to cause issues since
        the VPN is also trying to connect at the same time.

        This triggers a simultaneous start of the device engine, the API binder
        and the supevisor API to avoid delays.

        The latest upgrade of knex broke the webpack loader that hardcodes the

        migration paths in the built code, that cause supervisors 14.2.3 to

        14.2.5 (inclusive) to break anytime migrations needed to be ran (see
        linked issue).


        This commit fixes the loader to work with the included knex version.

      body: |
        The supervisor used to rely on specific event reporting for identifying
        issues at runtime. As the platform has grown, it has become much more
        difficult to get any signal from the event noise. Recently the API side
        for these events has been disabled, meaning these events only
        contribute to bandwidth consumption.  This commit disables the
        event reporting feature of the supervisor which will be most likely
        replaced by something like Sentry in the near future.

      hash: c6f911c36b8f9afeff5003db44199c95f5bbd8a2
      body: |
        The supervisor supports target state `running: false` for services.
        This state indicates that the service should be stopped if already
        running, or that the container should just be created and never started
        if the container does not exist. This commit fixes the latter behavior.

        Although nothing in our platform currently sends this target state, this
        enables some potential use cases, e.g. only starting some services
        in manufacturing and starting the rest of the services when the device
        actually connects.

      hash: 3e45e9561e109186ea038c6d3b67f54071ee8a67
      body: |
        `withDefault` is a type helper that allows to create a type that
        defaults to a default value when trying to decode a nullish value.
        That type was not correctly working with boolean types, causing `false`
        values to be replaced by true. This would specifically cause issues when
        parsing the target state, where a `running: false` in a service would
        become a `running: true` due to the type decoding.

    - subject: Fix filtering of the supervisor app on the target state
      hash: 5a57647450aa594b7112da01b9d2fc89885b6fae
      body: >
        Under some conditions, an aarch64 device may get a reference to a
        armv7hf

        supervisor on the target state. One of the ways this can happen is if

        an aarch64 device is added to an armv7hf fleet and the target supervisor

        is set before the device fully provisions.


        If that happens, the previous filtering for the supervisor app (which

        relied on the architecture in device-type.json) would

        fail and the user would end up with two supervisor containers, one

        running correctly and the other crash looping.


        This fixes the filtering and just checks if the supervisor uuid/service

        name belongs to a group of known uuids.

      body: |
        The supervisor uses the following pattern for async module
        initialization

        ```typescript
        // module.ts

        export const initialised = (async () => {
            // do some async initialization
        })();

        // somewhere else
        import * as module from 'module';

        async function setup() {
          await module.initialise;
        }
        ```

        The above pattern means that whenever the module is imported, the
        initialisation procedure will be ran, which is an anti-pattern.

        This converts any instance of this pattern into a function

        ```typescript
        export const initialised = _.once(async () => {
            // do some async initialization

        And anywhere else on the code it replaces the call with a

        ```typescript

      body: |
        This sets up the new `test/unit` and `test/integration` folders
        and starts classification of some of the test files.

        Note that unit tests include, `fs-utils` and `system-info` tests.

        While these tests interact with the filesystem, the implementation
        of these modules is simple enough, and the tests are fast enough to
        allow these tests to fall under the `unit` test category (according to
        test/README)

      hash: e1e35eb83b738040150ced1ee9500d780de4b632
      body: |
        We are refactoring the supervisor test suite into unit tests (for
        algorithms an domain model tests) and integration
        tests (for interaction with out-of-process dependencies).
        This means the current test suite needs to be classified into
        these two categories, and fixed whenever possible.

        This commit moves the test suite under the `test/legacy` folder, this
        folder should be progressively migrated and eventually removed.
        Subsequent commits will begin to split these files into unit and
        integration whenever possible.

      hash: 274503feb3f2f9cd5a8db551fd93b9cce8ae9b39
      body: |
        The supervisor used to perform tests both for the transpiled code (after
        tsc) and one for the typescript code (using
        ts-node/register/transpile-only). There is not really a reason for this
        and this added complexity to the test configuration. This used to make
        testing harder, as the built code didn't include source maps, meaning
        the tests did not point to the right code.

        Since we want to split tests in unit and integration tests as the next
        test improvement, it makes sense to simplify these commands before
        adding more complexity.

        State report errors contribute to the supervisor failing healthchecks
        and being restarted by the engine. There is not evidence of this
        improving the connectivity situation and it is likely to make things
        worst for the API as the first report is much more expensive than
        subsequent partial reports.

    - subject: Refactor supervisor Dockerfile to remove custom dependencies
      hash: 1722286a870d53acab9e5e8cfa372e07112f89e8
      body: >
        Restructure the supervisor image to remove the dependency on the custom
        `alpine-supervisor-base`

        image and the custom node build. The dockerfile is now a multi-stage

        build that splits the process into two build stages and two runtime

        stages.


        Here is the full list of changes


        - The node binary is now copied
        from  `balenalib/${ARCH}-alpine-node:12-run`, the node binary

        now supports running with a debugger.

        - The runtime image now inherits from the official `alpine:3.16` image

        - Tests are ran within the runtime image configuration instead of the
          build image
        - Livepush is ran within the runtime image context

        - Unnecessary packages have been removed

        - Removed avahi-daemon.conf as that service is not being used

        - Fix livepush to work with a multi-stage image. This also deprecates
        the `image-tag` argument to npm run sync as

        `SUPERVISOR_TAG` is no longer used by new OSs

        - Fix livepush build on old rpi devices. Allows passing a 'PREFIX'
          argument to let the builder pull images directly from docker hub arch
          repositories. Relates to https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/issues/269

        work with those types of locks when lock override is requested.

        the Supervisor container's /etc/hostname as it will match the host's

        /etc/hostname, the network mode being `host`.

      hash: a5ede01b18abd5e079361d24f2f8f5368d23da6d
      body: |
        Splash image backend would throw if the image is not a valid png during
        the write step. This could prevent the device from provisioning if some
        corruption happens at some point.

    - subject: Use write + sync when writing configs to /mnt/boot
      hash: c04955354a76ab32ab5dc52062fdf72d668f7c3b
      body: |
        This commit updates all backends that write to /mnt/boot to do it
        through a new `lib/host-utils` module. Writes are now done using write +
        sync as rename is not an atomic operation in vfat.

        The change also applies for writes through the `/v1/host-config`
        endpoint.

        Finally this change includes some improvements on tests.

      hash: 27249c278555c46154d1e917e769dd3fb9d2dcfc
      body: >
        The status field does not indicate the current state of the Engine on
        the device.

        Rather, it only indicates whether the HTTP response returned
        successfully or not.


        To get the current state of the device, i.e. whether it has applied
        target state or not,

        use the `appState` field in the response.

    - subject: Add lockfile binary and internal lib for interfacing with it
      hash: 51e63ea22b876580de276808eca891ff6ab2a6c5
      body: >
        The linked issue describes the Supervisor not cleaning up locks it
        creates due

        to crashing at just the wrong time. After internal discussion we decided
        to

        differentiate Supervisor-created lockfiles from user-created lockfiles
        by using

        the `nobody` UID (65534) for Supervisor-created lockfiles.


        As the existing NPM lockfile lib does not allow creating lockfiles
        atomically

        with different UIDs, we move to using the lockfile binary, which is part
        of the

        procmail package. To allow nonroot users to write to lock directories,
        permissions

        are changed to allow write access by nonroot users.

        This would cause the supervisor to enter a service restart loop as the
        current and target service configurations will never match. The
        supervisor now ignores selinux specific security options since those are
        not supported by balenaOS.

      hash: d071cd1507b8424628afa96ea1b1ed6b19225651
      body: |
        `/mnt/boot` is a vfat partition which does not support atomic file
        rename. The best course of action is to write and sync as fast as
        possible to prevent corruption (although it still may happen)

    - subject: Throw if target states gets a 304 without an ETAG
      hash: f471ad736c40afe7e4b50cb0fc46e8894d8dcdd7
      body: |
        The API uses 304 as a mechanism for load management on target state
        requests. This may cause that the supervisor receives a 304 response
        without having received a copy of the target state first, leading to
        issues. This change checks for an etag when receiving a 304, throwing an
        exception otherwise.

      hash: 39c667803d93182c595870352a597b9c07e1c9d1
      body: |
        The supervisor performs its own local resolution for `.local`
        addresses due to a limitation in [musl](https://wiki.musl-libc.org/future-ideas.html).
        The resolution function was not following exactly the nodejs [dns.lookup
        specification](https://nodejs.org/api/dns.html#dnslookuphostname-options-callback)
        which could cause certain clients to fail (in this case happy-eyeballs). This
        updates the function to follow the specification.

      hash: 9015b0e22f7edf973798d5ace3d60e32d43bb042
      body: >
        The supervisor always applies target state on start to ensure that the

        device is at the correct in case of a crash or another reason. This had

        the side effect that if the database is deleted, the supervisor would

        apply target state (which is empty), stopping services and possibly

        causing volume data loss.


        This prevents that behavior and ensures that the supervisor only

        applies target state if a target has been set either by the cloud,
        preload or local

        mode.

        PR #1824 changed app update behavior to test that all images are there
        before moving between releases. This check always fails in local mode
        since local mode images are handled differently.

        This PR fixes local mode again by skipping the check when `localMode` is
        set.

        For download-then-kill strategy, this waits for all changing images on
        the target

        release to be available on device before killing the old services. This

        will prevent that multicontainer applications get to a state where some

        services of the new release start runnning much before others have been

        downloaded.


        When adding new services to a multicontainer app, the supervisor will

        now wait for other changing services to be downloaded before starting

        the new service.

        We just added support for the TX2 NX, which supports u-boot
        thus allows for using custom device-trees. Let's allow
        for Jetson TX2 NX and future TX2 NX derived
        device types to have device-trees configurable from the dashboard.

    - subject: Fix regression with local mode push
      hash: 6f5f3bc2f3aea1bf5e5772533be80c3bfbb4e3a9
      body: |
        PR #1749 introduced a bug when pushing local target state. An update to
        the [image name normalization](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/blob/f1bd4b8d9bcef29e326cbf97eaddd837c2704d19/src/lib/docker-utils.ts#L81)
        failed to consider the local image name format. This results in mangling
        of image names in the database, i.e. the image `ubuntu:latest` is stored
        as `/ubuntu:latest`. This causes an exception to be returned by the
        dockerode `getImage('/ubuntu:latest').inspect()` call.

        This sends the supervisor into a crash loop and is shown on the supervisor
        journal logs as

        ```
        getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND images
            at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookup [as oncomplete] (dns.js:64:26)
        ```

        Unfortunately if this happens on a user device, since the mangled image
        name is already on the database, the easiest way to fix is to remove the
        supervisor database and let the supervisor recreate it. Deleting the
        database should be side effect free.

      body: >
        Preparing for the new v3 target state, where the supervisor will make
        environment

        dependent ids optional and rely on using general UUIDs and user known
        identifiers

        for comparison. This PR moves forward in that direction by removing some
        of those

        comparisons for v2 target state.


        - imageId to be replaced with imageName

        - serviceId to be replace by serviceName

        - releaseId to be replaced by commit (future release_uuid)


        This is a backwards compatible change, meaning it doesn't completely get
        rid of

        these identifiers (which are still being used by supervisor API and for
        state

        patch), but will not depend on those identifiers for calculating steps
        to target state.

    - subject: Use tags to track supervised images in docker
      hash: f1bd4b8d9bcef29e326cbf97eaddd837c2704d19
      body: >
        The image manager module now uses tags instead of docker IDs as the main

        way to identify docker images on the engine. That is, if the target

        state image has a name `imageName:tag@digest`, the supervisor will
        always use

        the given `imageName` and `tag` (which may be empty) to tag the image on

        the engine after fetching. This PR also adds checkups to ensure

        consistency is maintained between the database and the engine.


        Using tags allows to simplify query and removal operations, since now

        removing the image now means removing tags matching the image name.


        Before this change the supervisor relied only on information in the

        supervisor database, and used that to remove images by docker ID.
        However, the docker

        id is not a reliable identifier, since images retain the same id between

        releases or between services in the same release.


        List of squashed commits

        - Remove custom type NormalizedImageInfo

        - Remove dependency on docker-toolbelt

        - Use tags to traack supervised images in docker

        - Ensure tag removal occurs in sequence

        - Only save database image after download confirmed

        easier to test operations that interact with the engine. All references

        to the old mock-dockerode have not yet been removed but that should come

        soon in another PR


        List of squashed commits:

        - Add tests for network create/remove

        - Move compose service tests to test/src/compose and reorganize test
        descriptions

        - Add support for image creation to mockerode

        - Add additional tests for compose volumes

        - Update mockerode so unimplemented fake methods throw. This is to
        ensure
          tests using mockerode fail if an unimplemented method is used
        - Update tests for volume-manager with mockerode

        - Update tests for compose/images

        - Simplify tests using mockerode

        - Clean up compose/app tests

        - Create application manager tests

      hash: a9028e58ecb097f0106e74f6c4cd1b755fa9ece5
      body: |
        On HUP, some healthceck services need to complete before
        it's safe for the Supervisor to reboot the device when
        applying state changes. rollback-{health|altboot}-breadcrumb
        are the two files that Supervisor looks for and locks the device
        on when present in this patch.

        Not closing issue 1459 because there is a possible case where,
        on altboot rollback, the breadcrumbs are not present. 1459
        may be closed when this edge case is investigated.

    - subject: Show warning instead of exception for invalid network config
      hash: 5197a1330d69cbff97f3c53a77f640638e074b8a
      body: >
        A previous PR (#1656) fixed validation for network ipam config,

        checking that both network and subnet are defined for each ipam config
        entry

        (as described in the docker documentation).


        After that PR, the validations throws an exception if the network target
        state is incorrect,

        but this turns out to be the wrong approach, because that exception is
        also triggered

        when querying target state.


        This isn't a problem in normal operation, but it is in local mode,
        because local

        mode queries the old target state before sending a new one. Since the
        query fails,

        the CLI can never push the new target state.


        This PR replaces the exception with a warning on the logs, since a

        misconfigured network won't cause any engine failures, it will just

        prevent containers to communicate through the provided network.


        A future improvement should move this validation to an earlier point in
        the process,

        so the target state can get rejected before it even gets to a point it

        can be used.

      hash: 9c1d10dc318bb7c207608ed197c5713960642af3
      body: >
        The `start-resin-supervisor` script in newer OS version no longer uses
        the

        SUPERVISOR_TAG environment variable setup on supervisor.conf and

        update-supervisor.conf.


        This change removes the need for that variable with livepush supervisor

        to make it compatible with older and newer OS versions

      hash: 4a2ac557ef11d334154bafa0cab4e7272cbed749
      body: |
        'mz' can be safely replaced with fs.promises
        and util.promisify for faster native methods.
        'mkdirp' after Node v8 uses native fs.mkdir, thus
        is redundant. 'body-parser' is deprecated and
        contained within express v4.x.

      body: >
        The device request object was created with untouched fields left unset.
        When

        comparing state to determine if a transition is required this would

        result in a mismatch between:

            {
              Driver: '',
              Count: 1,
              DeviceIDs: null,
              Capabilities: [Array],
              Options: null
            }

        and

            {
              Count: 1,
              Capabilities: [Array],
            }

        Which in turn resulted in the target service being continously
        restarted.

        The fix is to instantiate the object in full.

        This will also make a copy of the default balena logo so the splash can

        This reverts commit 153655b523af94d8192f0e0eb5574c67fbf85008.


        Dependabot does not allow to limit version updates to just patches or
        security

        updates. Adding this configuration results in excess noise from

        major and minor versions. We are reverting this change for the moment

        and look for another version managment tool.

      hash: 4cdf26f82fd25284f7a7496fc2d91232c64a3e2e
      body: >
        This PR adds the following


        * Supervisor v1 API application actions now return HTTP status code 423
        when locks
          are preventing the action to be performed. Previously this resulted in a
          503 error
        * Supervisor API v2 service actions now returns HTTP status code 423
        when locks are
          preventing the action to be performed. Previously, this resulted in an
          exception logged by the supervisor and the API query timing out
        * Supervisor API `/v2/applications/:appId/start-service` now does not
          check for a lock. Lock handling in v2 actions is now performed by each
          step executor
        * `/v1/apps/:appId/start` now queries the target state and uses that
          information to execute the start step (as v2 does). Previously start
          resulted in `cannot get appId from undefined`
        * Extra tests for API methods

      hash: e4e895630f53ce5f00ebc5c1486a90b0f9ca9998
      body: |
        During first time run of the supervisor, the target state is queried
        by `reportInitialEnv`. Since this happens early on the initialization
        process, this target state report is missed by any listeners and this
        can lead to the initial target state not beeing applied (see #1455).

        This PR ensures that target state is re-emitted if there were no
        listeners setup on call to update.

        This paves the way for running multiple applications and storing
        information related to the application against the application itself. A
        couple of hacks have been added to v1 and v2 endpoints to maintain
        compatability but these should eventually be removed with the addition
        of a v3 api.

    - subject: Mount docker socket under `/host/run` for services
      hash: 01477e41b8d3b12aebd5460bec9ed1991fbbb270
      body: |
        Currently, when the label `io.balena.features.balena-socket` is set,
        the balena engine socket is mounted under `/run/balena-engine.sock`.

        This causes a problem when using systemd inside the container, since
        this service remounts `/run` and `/run/lock` as tmpfs, causing the
        socket to become unavailable.

        Making a mount of the socket into `/host/run` solves this issue. This is
        the same approach taken with DBUS.

      hash: 4795c336d055862706be42ebb544caef93d55e35
      body: |
        A docker-compose.yml with the following structure

        ```
        version: '2.1'
        services:
          app_1:
            build: ./noisy-1
            image: noisy1
          app_2:
            build: ./noisy-1
            image: noisy1
          app_3:
            build: ./noisy-1
            image: noisy1
        ```

        Will lead to the supervisor creating multiple image database entries
        with the same dockerId (this is because of how the engine handles this
        particular case). This case is not handled by the removal process
        leading to image pile up and increased disk usage.

      hash: dd5f62227a0b0d2024db924e7028c9fec8b2b1d9
      body: >
        The memory information reported by the supervisor currently

        estimates the value of used memory as `MemTotal - MemFree`.

        However, linux systems will try to cache and buffer as much

        memory as possible, which will affect the output of `MemFree`

        (from /proc/meminfo) and in consequence the memory usage seen

        by the user on the dashboard, which will appear much greater than

        it is.


        The correct calculation should be `MemTotal - MemFree - Buffers -
        Cached`,

        which the calculation performed by `htop` and the `free` commands.

        attempt to send data once every maxReportFrequency (although this does
        not mean that we will be sending data that often, we still only send the
        delta, if one exists)

      body: >
        In order to make supervisor upgrades more transparent, lets move away

        from this env var since it requires a container restart any time the
        supervisor

        is upgraded. We should ultimately move towards providing the supervisors

        set of capabilities, but that can come later

      hash: adffde932ec28b114a5821b9ae332a42bb330be2
      body: |
        Due to the singleton work, when performing migration M00005 and there
        are apps with services created in the database, a deadlock occurs
        during database initialization due to a circular
        dependency for generating scoped keys.

      hash: a5f3002e708c949b6de3c8ba495b2a89c13214fc
      body: |
        When trying to apply SSDT overlays in Up Board, the supervisor currently
        gets stuck in a loop trying to apply target state. See #1465

        This was due to a bug in parsing the configuration, which lead to
        the method bootConfigChangeRequired returning true when no change was
        needed.

      body: |
        Each service, when requesting access to the Supervisor API, will
        now get an individual key which can be scoped to specific resources.
        In this iteration the default scope will be to the application that
        the service belongs to.

        We also have a `global` scope which is used by the cloud API when in
        managed mode.

                        This is very similar to the cache class they use by
                        default, with the

                        difference that it has a limit and won't grow
                        indefinitely, causing

                        memory leaks on long running applications like
                        Jellyfish.

                        This is a hack, and should be reverted once we get to
                        the bottom of it.

                        It will impact performance, but right now there are
                        things that should

                        be filtered and are not, so lets get this merged for
                        security purposes.

                        Hopefully this library will be re-written soon.

                Handlebars supports very basic if condition checking, but it
                only checks for

                existence of a field. There are times when we want to combine
                conditions in order

                to generate something as part of a blueprint, without defining a
                completely separate

                blueprint for it (like generating network config schema if a dt
                has a wifi chip or

                a usb port to which we can connect a dongle).

                        supported when Pinejs ^10.19.0 is used.

      hash: ae646a07ec6a6c96f7cb91f1d37898a94dbab47a
      body: |
        In the absence of an upstream implementation of the DeviceRequest API introduced
        as part of Docker API v1.40 we roll our own using a feature label.

        As per my comment in the code, we fall back to the default behavior of
        docker cli's `--gpu` and request single device with the `gpu` capabilty.
        The only implementation at the moment is the NVIDIA driver; here:
        https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/blob/master/daemon/nvidia_linux.go

        Background on the composefile implementation:

        This allows a response to an input with dport=`supevisor api port` and
        is required when the host OS is doing stateful firewalling.

        This should not affect things when stateful firewalling is not in
        effect, as the standard OUTPUT chain policy is ACCEPT, so we're just
        being explicit about it.

      body: |
        We move the old sync.js script to tools/, and delete the now-broken
        sync-debug.js.

        We add a command `npm run sync`, which starts a livepush process
        with the supervisor on a device.

        We also remove the Makefile to go to a simpler build system, as long
        with

        the retry_docker_push.sh file. We remove the rest of the automation
        tools

        as they're no longer used and update the circle.yml file.


        We also remove debug builds, as these aren't needed moving forward, and
        were

        only to enable livepush builds.

        We add an implicit .0 to the end of l4t versions which do not fulfill
        semver, which allows us to always match using comparison operators, such
        as < and <=.

    - subject: Add a noinit option to sync-debug
      hash: c47ef6d42abfe840cfa833a9f8f3789e142299e6
      body: |
        The noinit option will avoid doing a complete sync to the supervisor
        on startup. This is useful when there has only been code changes, and no
        modules etc have been added. It can be helpful when running on a network
        with no external internet access, as everything needed is already inside
        the container.

        To aid this we also move to yargs, rather than try to do all of the
        parsing ourselves.

    - subject: Set a mock l4t version for use with optional containers
      hash: 8cece238a9a7d552d5366ffa4170ba8998bb8bbf
      body: |
        Before this change a mixed device fleet with a subset using l4t would
        not be able to have containers which only run on the l4t based boards.
        We add a mock l4t version so the contracts will always be denied on
        non-l4t boards, but the release itself won't fail to validate.

        This also required refactoring the request library to be generated with
        a promise, as we now no longer get the information synchronously.

        We also cache the release info, to avoid grabbing it again within the
        same runtime, which does not make sense.

      hash: 8b4c9837fa39bcb6642f7fd3208afa8d26b9af46
      body: >
        With this change, we define a custom error handler as express middleware

        which renders 503 error with JSON response that includes status and
        message

        fields.


        The handler also logs the error, so the stack can be inspected in
        supervisor

        logs. It's also a point where we can report the error to analytics
        services.


        This removes a bunch of error handlers written in every request handler

        function. Behaviour should remain unchanged except the fact that

        /healthy endpoint now returns 503 in case of failure instead of 500.

        The `createFromPath` method takes 3 parameters, while in a previous
        version it was only 2 (the new format splits the old format's first
        parameter into two, and keeping the last), before the refactor in commit
        23e564389daaa29feb231d1b091e07df82a7a300 (supervisor v9.18.4)
        The backup restoration call has not been updated and thus calls that
        function the old (wrong) way, resulting in failed restore, and volume
        management errors on a device that attempted a restore.

        That way that this is performed is by first adding a depends_on entry

        of the target container and replace the network_mode with
        `container:<id>`.

        When comparing state, we check that the containerId still points to the
        contianerId of the target container, and in this way we ensure that
        when a network mode target container changes, we change the dependent
        container too.

    - subject: Don't attempt to cleanup any target state referenced volumes
      hash: a796777967facb96ade32f5a06e256b3b92d1e4b
      body: |
        The code before this change could potentially remove a volume which
        should not be removed if a container was deleted before the call that
        references said volume.

        To avoid this, we additionally filter the list of volumes to cleanup by
        any that are referenced in the target state. This means that cleanup
        will never remove it, as long as it's still supposed to be there,
        regardless of if a container references it or not.

        unnecessary override'
      hash: 743c8406c973af7ef85ff31ea8bb0bc99d4592fb
      body: >
        Since we were comparing the VPN's value before adding the explicit
        "true", there were cases

        were the VPN is off, and therefore "value" didn't match the default, so
        the supervisor would

        create a device specific SUPERVISOR_VPN_CONTROL = true, which is
        unnecessary and causes issues if

        users don't expect this and move the device to an app that has VPN
        disabled. The correct behavior

        is to compare "varValue" and only create a device config var if this
        value differs from the default.


        (This was the behavior before the TS conversion in
        01ed7bb103b4df8fb0679cf858220db42d4a0b92 )

      body: |
        Changes in the node engine related to streams would cause the gzip
        streams flush function to be called at the wrong times. The sinon fake
        timers were also interacting with this.

        We use setImmediate to call the flush function, and remove sinon timers
        for the logging tests.

      hash: 0fa47f635bc9a05fea2d0f9b20a6cdc5a1797855
      body: |
        When assigning multiple host ports to a single container port before
        this change, the supervisor would incorrectly take only the first host
        port into consideration. This change makes it so that every host port
        per container port is considered.

        Prior to this change, we would `_.uniq` the expose value before adding
        values from the port mappings. This could cause ports to get added
        twice, which would cause the supervisor to think that there is a
        configuration mismatch.

        the api to reject the update unecessarily.

        reporting logs from the container. If this is the first time we've seen
        a container, we get all logs, and for every log reported we save the
        timestamp. If it is not the first time we've seen a container, we
        request all logs since the last reported time, ensuring no interruption
        of service.

    - subject: Add a random jitter to target state polls, and a config var to ignore
        update notifications and not poll immediately after startup
      hash: 8f07bf62de4a509ac74380af8be42b2acf3c1b76
      body: >
        This commit does two related things:


        * We make the poll interval a random time between 0.5 and 1.5 times the
        configured interval.

        * We introduce the BALENA_SUPERVISOR_INSTANT_UPDATE_TRIGGER
        configuration variable, that defaults to true. If this variable is set

        to false, then calls to /v1/update are ignored, and on startup the
        supervisor waits for a poll interval before getting the target state.


        This will help especially on cases where there's a large number of
        devices on a single network. By disabling instant updates and setting a
        large

        poll interval, we can now achieve a sitation where not all devices apply
        an update at the same time, which can help avoid

        overwhelming the network.

      body: |
        When comparing a stopped container after a start request, the container
        ID will be present in the target state (where usually it is not). We
        were already filtering this value out of the current state, but
        neglected to do so for the target state. This change now ensures we
        remove it from both alias lists if it exists.

        In an edge case observed in the field, a supervisor's database held two
        applications

        because the device had been moved and the update lock was set in the old
        app. This causes

        the updated supervisor to be unable to start, logging "No compatible
        releases found in API",

        because it can't fetch the release for the app it was moved from.


        This commit changes the migration code to iterate through all apps, and
        remove any for which

        we can't get a release.

        interrupts the initialization after provisioning completes but before
        pinning is completed, after a retry

        the supervisor would just skip the pinning code, leaving the device
        unpinned. This patch ensures that the

        pinning procedure is run even if the device was already provisioned (as
        long as the pinning flag has been set,

        of course). This matches the behavior that the CoffeeScript code had
        from before the TypeScript conversion.

      body: |
        We run the risk of the state engine exiting early when a dependency is
        not ready, especially in local mode. This changes forces a noop to be
        returned when we are waiting on another service, which is the process
        used elsewhere in the state engine.

        During the conversion to typescript, the VPN active check was being
        performed on the directory, and not the file that the VPN creates,

        directory on startup if it does not exist).

      hash: 6f797020998251384f6a6251f6ffe5614e4054fc
      body: |
        In the case of an airgapped supervisor, with a target state that
        requests the vpn be enabled, the supervisor will constantly loop on
        trying to set the vpn to on. Unfortunately the vpn requires an internet
        connection to be configured, so it will never be turned on.

        We add the concept of no-ops to the device-config state change steps,
        and don't end the state engine transition while these are present
        (similar to how image pulls are implemented).

        `'0'` (note strings as these are database values) - but if the value
        existed in the database already, this would fail validation. We add a
        migration which will look explcitily for the failing value and switch it
        to the new default.

      body: |
        We were validating the input configuration values by coercing them to
        the correct type, and then using the initial value to be saved (which
        currently is always converted to a string).

        We now use the coerced value as the actual value we will store, and more
        importantly emit. This means that the config.on('change' ...) calls will
        always be properly typed, which before this change was not a guarantee
        that we could make.

        it will match the docker output (if it should).

        We also don't sort in the fromComposePorts function anymore as that is
        handled by the normalize function.

        In the original implementation it was possible that the delete did not
        wait for the kill step to be finished, so it would not be deleted.

        We seperate this process into two steps, to allow for the container to
        have stopped before proceeding.

        Docker always returns ports in ascending order, so if they aren't
        specified like that in the compose, a restart loop would occur. This
        patch changes the port maps to be stored in ascending order, based on
        an alphabetical sort of the internalStart port (not taking into account
        the protocol). This is the same as how Docker returns them, so they will
        match, regardless of input form.

    - subject: Fix a race condition that could cause an unnecessary restart of a
        service immediately after download
      hash: 42737cb9e96b889d0fdfd48926778a38566d927b
      body: >
        Up to now, there was a slim but non-zero chance that an image would be
        downloaded between the call to `@getTarget` inside deviceState

        (which gets the target state and creates Service objects using
        information from available images), and the call to

        `@images.getAvailable` in ApplicationManager (which is used to determine
        whether we should keep waiting for a download or start the

        service). If this race condition happened, then the ApplicationManager
        would infer that a service was ready to be started (because

        the image appears as available), but would have incomplete information
        about the service because the image wasn't available when

        the Service object was created. The result would be that the service
        would be started, and then immediately on the next applyTarget

        the ApplicationManager would try to kill it and restart it to update it
        with the complete information from the image.


        This patch changes this behavior by ensuring that all of the additional
        information about the current state, which includes available images,

        is gathered *before* building the current and target states that we
        compare. This means that if the image is downloaded after the call to
        getAvailable, the Service might be constructed with all the information
        about the image, but it won't be started until the next pass, because
        ApplicationManager will treat it as still downloading.

        This file allows other components to uniquely parse the information that
        is contained in the changelog. It will be automatically managed by
        versionist by appending the new commits on top. This is needed to
        provide nested-changelogs.
