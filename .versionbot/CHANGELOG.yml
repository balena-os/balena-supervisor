    - subject: Convert ensureSupervisorNetwork to native Promises
      hash: 1034aa70e6a2e425fb4b5e0fa1155eec97b21ed2
      body: >
        Also remove system interface check from ensureSupervisorNetwork.


        Previously `ensure` was a Bluebird promise which wasn't awaited in

        its composition step. This has been here for some time and may contribute

        to issues with duplicate networks. The conversion to native Promises

        allows `ensure` to be awaited, hopefully reducing instances of duplicate

        networks.


        Removing the system interface check for /sys/class/net/supervisor0

        because it's superfluous given that the Engine creates the interface

        with NetworkManager. It also makes testing a lot more difficult to set up

        as /sys/class/net isn't a directory that can be written to for emulating

        system interface creation / removal.

      hash: fd320f85b53ec83f54cd6ad83cdf685dcc6e0d20
      body: |
        An unmanaged Supervisor will not have a balenaApi defined, so any
        attempts to POST /v2/local/target-state will cause the Supervisor to
        crash loop. This fix allows for the Supervisor to apply local target
        state, which is useful for integration testing.

      body: |
        The state engine and preloading is performed before the device gets a
        chance to register, while this is desirable for preloaded apps, it
        introduces a delay on registration which is known to cause issues since
        the VPN is also trying to connect at the same time.

        This triggers a simultaneous start of the device engine, the API binder
        and the supevisor API to avoid delays.

        This commit fixes the loader to work with the included knex version.

      body: |
        The supervisor used to rely on specific event reporting for identifying
        issues at runtime. As the platform has grown, it has become much more
        difficult to get any signal from the event noise. Recently the API side
        for these events has been disabled, meaning these events only
        contribute to bandwidth consumption.  This commit disables the
        event reporting feature of the supervisor which will be most likely
        replaced by something like Sentry in the near future.

    - subject: Only install service if running is set to false
      hash: c6f911c36b8f9afeff5003db44199c95f5bbd8a2
      body: |
        The supervisor supports target state `running: false` for services.
        This state indicates that the service should be stopped if already
        running, or that the container should just be created and never started
        if the container does not exist. This commit fixes the latter behavior.

        Although nothing in our platform currently sends this target state, this
        enables some potential use cases, e.g. only starting some services
        in manufacturing and starting the rest of the services when the device
        actually connects.

    - subject: Fix withDefault type helper to work with boolean
      hash: 3e45e9561e109186ea038c6d3b67f54071ee8a67
      body: |
        `withDefault` is a type helper that allows to create a type that
        defaults to a default value when trying to decode a nullish value.
        That type was not correctly working with boolean types, causing `false`
        values to be replaced by true. This would specifically cause issues when
        parsing the target state, where a `running: false` in a service would
        become a `running: true` due to the type decoding.

    - subject: Fix filtering of the supervisor app on the target state
      hash: 5a57647450aa594b7112da01b9d2fc89885b6fae
      body: >
        Under some conditions, an aarch64 device may get a reference to a armv7hf

        supervisor on the target state. One of the ways this can happen is if

        an aarch64 device is added to an armv7hf fleet and the target supervisor

        is set before the device fully provisions.


        If that happens, the previous filtering for the supervisor app (which

        relied on the architecture in device-type.json) would

        fail and the user would end up with two supervisor containers, one

        running correctly and the other crash looping.


        This fixes the filtering and just checks if the supervisor uuid/service

        name belongs to a group of known uuids.

    - subject: Remove side effects for module imports
      hash: 48e0733c7e734b401f6072df5a396dfc04075d98
      body: |
        The supervisor uses the following pattern for async module
        initialization

        ```typescript
        // module.ts

        export const initialised = (async () => {
            // do some async initialization
        })();

        // somewhere else
        import * as module from 'module';

        async function setup() {
          await module.initialise;
        }
        ```

        The above pattern means that whenever the module is imported, the
        initialisation procedure will be ran, which is an anti-pattern.

        This converts any instance of this pattern into a function

        ```typescript
        export const initialised = _.once(async () => {
            // do some async initialization
        });
        ```

        And anywhere else on the code it replaces the call with a

        ```typescript
        await module.initialised();
        ```

      body: |
        This sets up the new `test/unit` and `test/integration` folders
        and starts classification of some of the test files.

        Note that unit tests include, `fs-utils` and `system-info` tests.

        While these tests interact with the filesystem, the implementation
        of these modules is simple enough, and the tests are fast enough to
        allow these tests to fall under the `unit` test category (according to
        test/README)

      hash: e1e35eb83b738040150ced1ee9500d780de4b632
      body: |
        We are refactoring the supervisor test suite into unit tests (for
        algorithms an domain model tests) and integration
        tests (for interaction with out-of-process dependencies).
        This means the current test suite needs to be classified into
        these two categories, and fixed whenever possible.

        This commit moves the test suite under the `test/legacy` folder, this
        folder should be progressively migrated and eventually removed.
        Subsequent commits will begin to split these files into unit and
        integration whenever possible.

      hash: 274503feb3f2f9cd5a8db551fd93b9cce8ae9b39
      body: |
        The supervisor used to perform tests both for the transpiled code (after
        tsc) and one for the typescript code (using
        ts-node/register/transpile-only). There is not really a reason for this
        and this added complexity to the test configuration. This used to make
        testing harder, as the built code didn't include source maps, meaning
        the tests did not point to the right code.

        Since we want to split tests in unit and integration tests as the next
        test improvement, it makes sense to simplify these commands before
        adding more complexity.

        State report errors contribute to the supervisor failing healthchecks
        and being restarted by the engine. There is not evidence of this
        improving the connectivity situation and it is likely to make things
        worst for the API as the first report is much more expensive than
        subsequent partial reports.

    - subject: Refactor supervisor Dockerfile to remove custom dependencies
      hash: 1722286a870d53acab9e5e8cfa372e07112f89e8
      body: >
        Restructure the supervisor image to remove the dependency on the custom
        `alpine-supervisor-base`

        image and the custom node build. The dockerfile is now a multi-stage

        build that splits the process into two build stages and two runtime

        stages.


        Here is the full list of changes


        - The node binary is now copied from  `balenalib/${ARCH}-alpine-node:12-run`, the node binary

        now supports running with a debugger.

        - The runtime image now inherits from the official `alpine:3.16` image

        - Tests are ran within the runtime image configuration instead of the
          build image
        - Livepush is ran within the runtime image context

        - Unnecessary packages have been removed

        - Removed avahi-daemon.conf as that service is not being used

        - Fix livepush to work with a multi-stage image. This also deprecates the `image-tag` argument to npm run sync as

        `SUPERVISOR_TAG` is no longer used by new OSs

        - Fix livepush build on old rpi devices. Allows passing a 'PREFIX'
          argument to let the builder pull images directly from docker hub arch
          repositories. Relates to https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/issues/269

      hash: 99efd12acd05290b5fc2ae74da3226d150dc86e6
      body: |
        This fixes a race condition that could occur with the first current
        state report, where if the device managed to send the current state
        report first, then the device name on the cloud would be set to `local`
        (see #1959).

        balena-compose already supports this, and with this PR, Supervisor can

        have the option of using HostConfig.Mounts for internal bind mounts such as

        ones added by feature labels. This will be handled in a future PR.


        The only blocker to having users use long syntax is adding this feature

        to target state. This PR does not add that feature.

        This commit updates all backends that write to /mnt/boot to do it
        through a new `lib/host-utils` module. Writes are now done using write +
        sync as rename is not an atomic operation in vfat.

        The change also applies for writes through the `/v1/host-config`
        endpoint.

        Finally this change includes some improvements on tests.

        The status field does not indicate the current state of the Engine on the

        Rather, it only indicates whether the HTTP response returned successfully or not.


        To get the current state of the device, i.e. whether it has applied target state or not,

        use the `appState` field in the response.

      hash: 51e63ea22b876580de276808eca891ff6ab2a6c5
      body: >
        The linked issue describes the Supervisor not cleaning up locks it creates
        due

        to crashing at just the wrong time. After internal discussion we decided to

        differentiate Supervisor-created lockfiles from user-created lockfiles by using

        the `nobody` UID (65534) for Supervisor-created lockfiles.


        As the existing NPM lockfile lib does not allow creating lockfiles atomically

        with different UIDs, we move to using the lockfile binary, which is part of the

        procmail package. To allow nonroot users to write to lock directories, permissions

        are changed to allow write access by nonroot users.

        The check for the docker network supervisor0 assumed that if the

        true on the case of docker directory corruption, which would lead to a

      body: >
        The moby engine v20.x.y adds some selinux [security

        depending on the [container configuration](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/daemon/create.go#L214).

        This would cause the supervisor to enter a service restart loop as the

        current and target service configurations will never match. The

        supervisor now ignores selinux specific security options since those are

        not supported by balenaOS.

      body: |
        The API uses 304 as a mechanism for load management on target state
        requests. This may cause that the supervisor receives a 304 response
        without having received a copy of the target state first, leading to
        issues. This change checks for an etag when receiving a 304, throwing an
        exception otherwise.

      body: >
        The supervisor performs its own local resolution for `.local`

        addresses due to a limitation in [musl](https://wiki.musl-libc.org/future-ideas.html).

        The resolution function was not following exactly the nodejs [dns.lookup

        specification](https://nodejs.org/api/dns.html#dnslookuphostname-options-callback)

        which could cause certain clients to fail (in this case happy-eyeballs). This

        updates the function to follow the specification.

      hash: 9015b0e22f7edf973798d5ace3d60e32d43bb042
      body: >
        The supervisor always applies target state on start to ensure that the

        device is at the correct in case of a crash or another reason. This had

        the side effect that if the database is deleted, the supervisor would

        apply target state (which is empty), stopping services and possibly

        causing volume data loss.


        This prevents that behavior and ensures that the supervisor only

        applies target state if a target has been set either by the cloud, preload or local

        mode.

      body: |
        The strategy has been broken for a while but it was not clear how to
        fix it before the changes to image management. This PR fixes application
        manager to remove images before downloading the new image. This will
        only have an effect on changing images.

      hash: 7aedc97ee185953a3068ce3ef9743989e32a75b2
      body: >
        For download-then-kill strategy, this waits for all changing images on the
        target

        release to be available on device before killing the old services. This

        will prevent that multicontainer applications get to a state where some

        services of the new release start runnning much before others have been

        downloaded.


        When adding new services to a multicontainer app, the supervisor will

        now wait for other changing services to be downloaded before starting

        the new service.

        This removes the need for the app module to know about the naming
        conventions for networks and volumes since those exist now within the
        service itself. This also fixes a small bug where the volume would be
        removed before the service itself had been successfully stopped.

      hash: 6f5f3bc2f3aea1bf5e5772533be80c3bfbb4e3a9
      body: >
        PR #1749 introduced a bug when pushing local target state. An update to

        the [image name normalization](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-supervisor/blob/f1bd4b8d9bcef29e326cbf97eaddd837c2704d19/src/lib/docker-utils.ts#L81)

        failed to consider the local image name format. This results in mangling

        of image names in the database, i.e. the image `ubuntu:latest` is stored

        as `/ubuntu:latest`. This causes an exception to be returned by the

        dockerode `getImage('/ubuntu:latest').inspect()` call.


        This sends the supervisor into a crash loop and is shown on the supervisor

        journal logs as


        ```

        getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND images
            at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookup [as oncomplete] (dns.js:64:26)
        ```


        Unfortunately if this happens on a user device, since the mangled image

        name is already on the database, the easiest way to fix is to remove the

        supervisor database and let the supervisor recreate it. Deleting the

        database should be side effect free.

      hash: b67f94802dd8c2e890121f6ca82eda8dff2c051c
      body: >
        Preparing for the new v3 target state, where the supervisor will make
        environment

        dependent ids optional and rely on using general UUIDs and user known identifiers

        for comparison. This PR moves forward in that direction by removing some of those

        comparisons for v2 target state.


        - imageId to be replaced with imageName

        - serviceId to be replace by serviceName

        - releaseId to be replaced by commit (future release_uuid)


        This is a backwards compatible change, meaning it doesn't completely get rid of

        these identifiers (which are still being used by supervisor API and for state

        patch), but will not depend on those identifiers for calculating steps to target state.

    - subject: Use tags to track supervised images in docker
      hash: f1bd4b8d9bcef29e326cbf97eaddd837c2704d19
      body: >
        The image manager module now uses tags instead of docker IDs as the main

        way to identify docker images on the engine. That is, if the target

        state image has a name `imageName:tag@digest`, the supervisor will always use

        the given `imageName` and `tag` (which may be empty) to tag the image on

        the engine after fetching. This PR also adds checkups to ensure

        consistency is maintained between the database and the engine.


        Using tags allows to simplify query and removal operations, since now

        removing the image now means removing tags matching the image name.


        Before this change the supervisor relied only on information in the

        supervisor database, and used that to remove images by docker ID. However, the docker

        id is not a reliable identifier, since images retain the same id between

        releases or between services in the same release.

        The previous module was using `rewire` to get the knex instance from the

        This provides a fix for the test module that just removes the destroy

      body: >
        This PR cleans up testing for supervisor compose modules. It also fixes
        broken

        tests for application manager and removes a lot of dependencies for those tests

        on DB and other unnecessary mocks. There are probably a lot of cases that tests

        are missing but this should make writing new tests a lot easier.


        This PR also creates a new mock dockerode (mockerode) module that should make it

        easier to test operations that interact with the engine. All references

        to the old mock-dockerode have not yet been removed but that should come

        soon in another PR

      body: |
        On HUP, some healthceck services need to complete before
        it's safe for the Supervisor to reboot the device when
        applying state changes. rollback-{health|altboot}-breadcrumb
        are the two files that Supervisor looks for and locks the device
        on when present in this patch.

        Not closing issue 1459 because there is a possible case where,
        on altboot rollback, the breadcrumbs are not present. 1459
        may be closed when this edge case is investigated.

    - subject: Show warning instead of exception for invalid network config
      hash: 5197a1330d69cbff97f3c53a77f640638e074b8a
      body: >
        A previous PR (#1656) fixed validation for network ipam config,

        checking that both network and subnet are defined for each ipam config entry

        (as described in the docker documentation).


        After that PR, the validations throws an exception if the network target state is incorrect,

        but this turns out to be the wrong approach, because that exception is also triggered

        when querying target state.


        This isn't a problem in normal operation, but it is in local mode, because local

        mode queries the old target state before sending a new one. Since the query fails,

        the CLI can never push the new target state.


        This PR replaces the exception with a warning on the logs, since a

        misconfigured network won't cause any engine failures, it will just

        prevent containers to communicate through the provided network.


        A future improvement should move this validation to an earlier point in the process,

        so the target state can get rejected before it even gets to a point it

        can be used.

        whilst waiting for the supervisor to report them as part of a state

        This change removes the need for that variable with livepush supervisor

        to make it compatible with older and newer OS versions

      body: |
        'mz' can be safely replaced with fs.promises
        and util.promisify for faster native methods.
        'mkdirp' after Node v8 uses native fs.mkdir, thus
        is redundant. 'body-parser' is deprecated and
        contained within express v4.x.

        volumes
      hash: 31effed426750fabc30afb8503ec5b9feedf08b5
      body: >
        Using safeStateClone within doPurge to applyIntermediateTarget after

        successful volume purge has led to various type deficiencies being revealed

        in common.js. Add several inline types in common.js to satisfy

        the type checker (credit: Page <page@balena.io>). Delete common.d.ts

        since it's not required and might mistakenly mask true I/O types of

        functions in common.js.

        The device request object was created with untouched fields left unset.
        When

        comparing state to determine if a transition is required this would

        result in a mismatch between:

            {
              Driver: '',
              Count: 1,
              DeviceIDs: null,
              Capabilities: [Array],
              Options: null
            }

        and

            {
              Count: 1,
              Capabilities: [Array],
            }

        Which in turn resulted in the target service being continously restarted.

        The fix is to instantiate the object in full.

        This will also make a copy of the default balena logo so the splash can

        be restored if the variable is removed.

        This reverts commit 153655b523af94d8192f0e0eb5574c67fbf85008.


        Dependabot does not allow to limit version updates to just patches or security

        updates. Adding this configuration results in excess noise from

        major and minor versions. We are reverting this change for the moment

        and look for another version managment tool.

    - subject: Improve supervisor API behavior when locks are set
      hash: 4cdf26f82fd25284f7a7496fc2d91232c64a3e2e
      body: >
        This PR adds the following


        * Supervisor v1 API application actions now return HTTP status code 423 when locks
          are preventing the action to be performed. Previously this resulted in a
          503 error
        * Supervisor API v2 service actions now returns HTTP status code 423 when locks are
          preventing the action to be performed. Previously, this resulted in an
          exception logged by the supervisor and the API query timing out
        * Supervisor API `/v2/applications/:appId/start-service` now does not
          check for a lock. Lock handling in v2 actions is now performed by each
          step executor
        * `/v1/apps/:appId/start` now queries the target state and uses that
          information to execute the start step (as v2 does). Previously start
          resulted in `cannot get appId from undefined`
        * Extra tests for API methods

      hash: e4e895630f53ce5f00ebc5c1486a90b0f9ca9998
      body: |
        During first time run of the supervisor, the target state is queried
        by `reportInitialEnv`. Since this happens early on the initialization
        process, this target state report is missed by any listeners and this
        can lead to the initial target state not beeing applied (see #1455).

        This PR ensures that target state is re-emitted if there were no
        listeners setup on call to update.

        This paves the way for running multiple applications and storing
        information related to the application against the application itself. A
        couple of hacks have been added to v1 and v2 endpoints to maintain
        compatability but these should eventually be removed with the addition
        of a v3 api.

      hash: 01477e41b8d3b12aebd5460bec9ed1991fbbb270
      body: |
        Currently, when the label `io.balena.features.balena-socket` is set,
        the balena engine socket is mounted under `/run/balena-engine.sock`.

        This causes a problem when using systemd inside the container, since
        this service remounts `/run` and `/run/lock` as tmpfs, causing the
        socket to become unavailable.

        Making a mount of the socket into `/host/run` solves this issue. This is
        the same approach taken with DBUS.

      hash: 4795c336d055862706be42ebb544caef93d55e35
      body: |
        A docker-compose.yml with the following structure

        ```
        version: '2.1'
        services:
          app_1:
            build: ./noisy-1
            image: noisy1
          app_2:
            build: ./noisy-1
            image: noisy1
          app_3:
            build: ./noisy-1
            image: noisy1
        ```

        Will lead to the supervisor creating multiple image database entries
        with the same dockerId (this is because of how the engine handles this
        particular case). This case is not handled by the removal process
        leading to image pile up and increased disk usage.

      hash: dd5f62227a0b0d2024db924e7028c9fec8b2b1d9
      body: >
        The memory information reported by the supervisor currently

        estimates the value of used memory as `MemTotal - MemFree`.

        However, linux systems will try to cache and buffer as much

        memory as possible, which will affect the output of `MemFree`

        (from /proc/meminfo) and in consequence the memory usage seen

        by the user on the dashboard, which will appear much greater than

        it is.


        The correct calculation should be `MemTotal - MemFree - Buffers - Cached`,

        which the calculation performed by `htop` and the `free` commands.

        attempt to send data once every maxReportFrequency (although this does
        not mean that we will be sending data that often, we still only send the
        delta, if one exists)

        When trying to apply SSDT overlays in Up Board, the supervisor currently
        gets stuck in a loop trying to apply target state. See #1465

        This was due to a bug in parsing the configuration, which lead to
        the method bootConfigChangeRequired returning true when no change was
        needed.

        Each service, when requesting access to the Supervisor API, will
        now get an individual key which can be scoped to specific resources.
        In this iteration the default scope will be to the application that
        the service belongs to.

        We also have a `global` scope which is used by the cloud API when in
        managed mode.

                The change type is considered 'major' because, by default, errors are

                now thrown for relatively common occurrences such as authentication

                failures when pulling from private registries, and library users may

                have to adapt.

                        This is a hack, and should be reverted once we get to the bottom of it.

                        It will impact performance, but right now there are things that should

                        be filtered and are not, so lets get this merged for security purposes.

                        Hopefully this library will be re-written soon.

                Handlebars supports very basic if condition checking, but it only checks
                for

                existence of a field. There are times when we want to combine conditions in order

                to generate something as part of a blueprint, without defining a completely separate

                blueprint for it (like generating network config schema if a dt has a wifi chip or

                a usb port to which we can connect a dongle).

      body: >
        In the absence of an upstream implementation of the DeviceRequest API
        introduced

        as part of Docker API v1.40 we roll our own using a feature label.


        As per my comment in the code, we fall back to the default behavior of

        docker cli's `--gpu` and request single device with the `gpu` capabilty.

        The only implementation at the moment is the NVIDIA driver; here:

        https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/blob/master/daemon/nvidia_linux.go


        Background on the composefile implementation:

        We were treating the database class as a singleton, but still having to
        pass

        around the db instance. Now we can simply require the db module and have

        access to the database handle.

        This allows a response to an input with dport=`supevisor api port` and
        is required when the host OS is doing stateful firewalling.

        This should not affect things when stateful firewalling is not in
        effect, as the standard OUTPUT chain policy is ACCEPT, so we're just
        being explicit about it.

      hash: 8ab63656bd483645fe0238fee2a1824158f3f453
      body: |
        We move the old sync.js script to tools/, and delete the now-broken
        sync-debug.js.

        We add a command `npm run sync`, which starts a livepush process
        with the supervisor on a device.

        We also remove the Makefile to go to a simpler build system, as long with

        the retry_docker_push.sh file. We remove the rest of the automation tools

        as they're no longer used and update the circle.yml file.


        We also remove debug builds, as these aren't needed moving forward, and were

        only to enable livepush builds.

      hash: c47ef6d42abfe840cfa833a9f8f3789e142299e6
      body: |
        The noinit option will avoid doing a complete sync to the supervisor
        on startup. This is useful when there has only been code changes, and no
        modules etc have been added. It can be helpful when running on a network
        with no external internet access, as everything needed is already inside
        the container.

        To aid this we also move to yargs, rather than try to do all of the
        parsing ourselves.

        It's done lazily on the first public method call.

        Implementation is also rewritten to follow async/await pattern.

        Before this change a mixed device fleet with a subset using l4t would
        not be able to have containers which only run on the l4t based boards.
        We add a mock l4t version so the contracts will always be denied on
        non-l4t boards, but the release itself won't fail to validate.

        These contracts can specify an OS version and supervisor version that
        they require. If any of the containers in a release have requirements
        that are not met, the release is rejected, and the previous release
        continues to run.

      body: |
        This also required refactoring the request library to be generated with
        a promise, as we now no longer get the information synchronously.

        We also cache the release info, to avoid grabbing it again within the
        same runtime, which does not make sense.

    - subject: Unify API errors processing
      hash: 8b4c9837fa39bcb6642f7fd3208afa8d26b9af46
      body: >
        With this change, we define a custom error handler as express middleware

        which renders 503 error with JSON response that includes status and message

        fields.


        The handler also logs the error, so the stack can be inspected in supervisor

        logs. It's also a point where we can report the error to analytics services.


        This removes a bunch of error handlers written in every request handler

        function. Behaviour should remain unchanged except the fact that

        /healthy endpoint now returns 503 in case of failure instead of 500.

      hash: 7d1da3818479e33141890a8f3d09557303331872
      body: |
        If an error fires when writing to the cloud stream, it can stop any
        calling processes from completing. Given that a logging failure should
        not cause other processes to cancel, we catch and report the error but
        otherwise do nothing else.

      hash: ca9f8ffca1e306d4f4551a505b93b0bc7c679c81
      body: |
        The `createFromPath` method takes 3 parameters, while in a previous
        version it was only 2 (the new format splits the old format's first
        parameter into two, and keeping the last), before the refactor in commit
        23e564389daaa29feb231d1b091e07df82a7a300 (supervisor v9.18.4)
        The backup restoration call has not been updated and thus calls that
        function the old (wrong) way, resulting in failed restore, and volume
        management errors on a device that attempted a restore.

        The docker daemon can sometimes return null for various fields,
        or omit the field altogether. The best thing to do with using
        the docker api is to always use == null to cover both instances.

        With this change, supervisor also detects its own resources and does not delete them

        if it was updated during local mode operations.

      body: |
        That way that this is performed is by first adding a depends_on entry
        for the target service if it appears in a network mode. Then when we
        generate the docker container for this service, we use the containerId
        of the target container and replace the network_mode with
        `container:<id>`.

        When comparing state, we check that the containerId still points to the
        contianerId of the target container, and in this way we ensure that
        when a network mode target container changes, we change the dependent
        container too.

      hash: a796777967facb96ade32f5a06e256b3b92d1e4b
      body: |
        The code before this change could potentially remove a volume which
        should not be removed if a container was deleted before the call that
        references said volume.

        To avoid this, we additionally filter the list of volumes to cleanup by
        any that are referenced in the target state. This means that cleanup
        will never remove it, as long as it's still supposed to be there,
        regardless of if a container references it or not.

      hash: 743c8406c973af7ef85ff31ea8bb0bc99d4592fb
      body: >
        Since we were comparing the VPN's value before adding the explicit "true",
        there were cases

        were the VPN is off, and therefore "value" didn't match the default, so the supervisor would

        create a device specific SUPERVISOR_VPN_CONTROL = true, which is unnecessary and causes issues if

        users don't expect this and move the device to an app that has VPN disabled. The correct behavior

        is to compare "varValue" and only create a device config var if this value differs from the default.

    - subject: Ensure that all architectures use a node version that supports ci
      hash: 557f88965a8f076cf7a1a02ad965264f1c5beab9
      body: |
        We do this by using the standalone installer pinned at v6.9.0. We use
        the standalone installer because npm itself fails to upgrade on the
        i386-nlp build (npm v3). The standalone installer is installed in /tmp,
        and then to avoid mysterious CI errors, we use the original npm to run
        the tests.

        Changes in the node engine related to streams would cause the gzip

        We use setImmediate to call the flush function, and remove sinon timers
        for the logging tests.

        When assigning multiple host ports to a single container port before
        this change, the supervisor would incorrectly take only the first host
        port into consideration. This change makes it so that every host port
        per container port is considered.

        Prior to this change, we would `_.uniq` the expose value before adding

        twice, which would cause the supervisor to think that there is a
        configuration mismatch.

        the api to reject the update unecessarily.

        We add a database table, which holds information about the last

        We then use this value to calculate from which point in time to start
        reporting logs from the container. If this is the first time we've seen
        a container, we get all logs, and for every log reported we save the
        timestamp. If it is not the first time we've seen a container, we
        request all logs since the last reported time, ensuring no interruption
        of service.

    - subject: Add a random jitter to target state polls, and a config var to ignore
        update notifications and not poll immediately after startup
      hash: 8f07bf62de4a509ac74380af8be42b2acf3c1b76
      body: >
        This commit does two related things:


        * We make the poll interval a random time between 0.5 and 1.5 times the configured interval.

        * We introduce the BALENA_SUPERVISOR_INSTANT_UPDATE_TRIGGER configuration variable, that defaults to true. If this variable is set

        to false, then calls to /v1/update are ignored, and on startup the supervisor waits for a poll interval before getting the target state.


        This will help especially on cases where there's a large number of devices on a single network. By disabling instant updates and setting a large

        poll interval, we can now achieve a sitation where not all devices apply an update at the same time, which can help avoid

        overwhelming the network.

      body: |
        When comparing a stopped container after a start request, the container
        ID will be present in the target state (where usually it is not). We
        were already filtering this value out of the current state, but
        neglected to do so for the target state. This change now ensures we
        remove it from both alias lists if it exists.

        In an edge case observed in the field, a supervisor's database held two

        because the device had been moved and the update lock was set in the old app. This causes

        the updated supervisor to be unable to start, logging "No compatible releases found in API",

        because it can't fetch the release for the app it was moved from.


        This commit changes the migration code to iterate through all apps, and remove any for which

        we can't get a release.

        default network. This was because we were not explicitly adding aliases
        of the service names to the aliases fields.

        We also fix the comparison, which would do funny things based on
        container IDs, which was correct but unnecessary.

        Without this patch, if for some reason device pinning fails (e.g.
        connectivity goes down) or anything

        interrupts the initialization after provisioning completes but before pinning is completed, after a retry

        the supervisor would just skip the pinning code, leaving the device unpinned. This patch ensures that the

        pinning procedure is run even if the device was already provisioned (as long as the pinning flag has been set,

        of course). This matches the behavior that the CoffeeScript code had from before the TypeScript conversion.

      body: |
        In the case of an airgapped supervisor, with a target state that
        requests the vpn be enabled, the supervisor will constantly loop on
        trying to set the vpn to on. Unfortunately the vpn requires an internet
        connection to be configured, so it will never be turned on.

        We add the concept of no-ops to the device-config state change steps,
        and don't end the state engine transition while these are present
        (similar to how image pulls are implemented).

      hash: 06580bf437c49b18213d7e0e5ed72c2cfc427c7f
      body: |
        Non-200 errors were causing the watchdog to restart the supervisor,
        which in some cases could cause a restart loop. Instead we change the
        code to only treat communication failures as an error, and report status
        code failures directly.

      body: |
        We were not allowing newlines previously by virtue of the regex not
        allowing them. The docker daemon and supervisor handling code both
        support them, so we allow them in the parsing code too.

      hash: 3d6dc88eb0c77d4bdeec93645d01d730c54e87d7
      body: |
        We were validating the input configuration values by coercing them to
        the correct type, and then using the initial value to be saved (which
        currently is always converted to a string).

        We now use the coerced value as the actual value we will store, and more
        importantly emit. This means that the config.on('change' ...) calls will
        always be properly typed, which before this change was not a guarantee
        that we could make.

      hash: f3264862ca73e9b059da7fa7ce19aa67bfb9c296
      body: |
        Adjacent ports are always grouped together by docker when reporting the
        container state (from an inspect), so adjacent ports defined in the
        compose file would not match as they would not have been normalized.

        We make sure to always normalize the input port configuration, so that
        it will match the docker output (if it should).

        We also don't sort in the fromComposePorts function anymore as that is
        handled by the normalize function.

      body: |
        In the original implementation it was possible that the delete did not
        wait for the kill step to be finished, so it would not be deleted.

        We seperate this process into two steps, to allow for the container to
        have stopped before proceeding.

        Docker always returns ports in ascending order, so if they aren't
        specified like that in the compose, a restart loop would occur. This
        patch changes the port maps to be stored in ascending order, based on
        an alphabetical sort of the internalStart port (not taking into account
        the protocol). This is the same as how Docker returns them, so they will
        match, regardless of input form.

    - subject: Fix a race condition that could cause an unnecessary restart of a
        service immediately after download
      hash: 42737cb9e96b889d0fdfd48926778a38566d927b
      body: >
        Up to now, there was a slim but non-zero chance that an image would be
        downloaded between the call to `@getTarget` inside deviceState

        (which gets the target state and creates Service objects using information from available images), and the call to

        `@images.getAvailable` in ApplicationManager (which is used to determine whether we should keep waiting for a download or start the

        service). If this race condition happened, then the ApplicationManager would infer that a service was ready to be started (because

        the image appears as available), but would have incomplete information about the service because the image wasn't available when

        the Service object was created. The result would be that the service would be started, and then immediately on the next applyTarget

        the ApplicationManager would try to kill it and restart it to update it with the complete information from the image.


        This patch changes this behavior by ensuring that all of the additional information about the current state, which includes available images,

        is gathered *before* building the current and target states that we compare. This means that if the image is downloaded after the call to getAvailable, the Service might be constructed with all the information about the image, but it won't be started until the next pass, because ApplicationManager will treat it as still downloading.
