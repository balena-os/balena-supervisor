      hash: ea1b247d3fad9587ee9f71ff8831e14e3d6854c6
      body: |
        During the conversion to typescript, the VPN active check was being
        performed on the directory, and not the file that the VPN creates,
        meaning it would always return true (as we explicitly create the
        directory on startup if it does not exist).

      hash: 6f797020998251384f6a6251f6ffe5614e4054fc
      body: |
        In the case of an airgapped supervisor, with a target state that
        requests the vpn be enabled, the supervisor will constantly loop on
        trying to set the vpn to on. Unfortunately the vpn requires an internet
        connection to be configured, so it will never be turned on.

        We add the concept of no-ops to the device-config state change steps,
        and don't end the state engine transition while these are present
        (similar to how image pulls are implemented).

        When using the label `io.balena.features.balena-api` the supervisor will

        variables into the container:

        - BALENA_API_KEY

        - BALENA_API_URL


        This allows the container to access the currently associated API using
        the KEY.

      body: |
        The default value for the delta apply timeout was changed from `''` to
        `'0'` (note strings as these are database values) - but if the value
        existed in the database already, this would fail validation. We add a
        migration which will look explcitily for the failing value and switch it
        to the new default.

      body: |
        Non-200 errors were causing the watchdog to restart the supervisor,
        which in some cases could cause a restart loop. Instead we change the
        code to only treat communication failures as an error, and report status
        code failures directly.

      hash: 3d6dc88eb0c77d4bdeec93645d01d730c54e87d7
      body: |
        We were validating the input configuration values by coercing them to
        the correct type, and then using the initial value to be saved (which
        currently is always converted to a string).

        We now use the coerced value as the actual value we will store, and more
        importantly emit. This means that the config.on('change' ...) calls will
        always be properly typed, which before this change was not a guarantee
        that we could make.

      body: |
        Adjacent ports are always grouped together by docker when reporting the
        container state (from an inspect), so adjacent ports defined in the
        compose file would not match as they would not have been normalized.

        We make sure to always normalize the input port configuration, so that
        it will match the docker output (if it should).

        We also don't sort in the fromComposePorts function anymore as that is
        handled by the normalize function.

        In the original implementation it was possible that the delete did not

        have stopped before proceeding.

      body: |
        Docker always returns ports in ascending order, so if they aren't
        specified like that in the compose, a restart loop would occur. This
        patch changes the port maps to be stored in ascending order, based on
        an alphabetical sort of the internalStart port (not taking into account
        the protocol). This is the same as how Docker returns them, so they will
        match, regardless of input form.

        Fix a race condition that could cause an unnecessary restart of a
        service immediately after download
      hash: 42737cb9e96b889d0fdfd48926778a38566d927b
      body: >
        Up to now, there was a slim but non-zero chance that an image would be
        downloaded between the call to `@getTarget` inside deviceState

        (which gets the target state and creates Service objects using
        information from available images), and the call to

        `@images.getAvailable` in ApplicationManager (which is used to determine
        whether we should keep waiting for a download or start the

        service). If this race condition happened, then the ApplicationManager
        would infer that a service was ready to be started (because

        the image appears as available), but would have incomplete information
        about the service because the image wasn't available when

        the Service object was created. The result would be that the service
        would be started, and then immediately on the next applyTarget

        the ApplicationManager would try to kill it and restart it to update it
        with the complete information from the image.


        This patch changes this behavior by ensuring that all of the additional
        information about the current state, which includes available images,

        is gathered *before* building the current and target states that we
        compare. This means that if the image is downloaded after the call to
        getAvailable, the Service might be constructed with all the information
        about the image, but it won't be started until the next pass, because
        ApplicationManager will treat it as still downloading.
